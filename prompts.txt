What’s the defect type of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) in the following commit?
A defect type can be one of the following categories: 1) Assignment/Initialization: a problem related to an assignment of a variable or no assignment at all; 2) Checking: a problem with conditional logic (e.g., condition in a if-clause or in a loop); 3) Timing: a problem with serialization of shared resources; 4) Algorithm/Method: a problem with implementation that does not require a design change to be fixed; 5) Function: a problem that needs a reasonable amount of code to be fixed due to incorrect implementation or no implementation at all; 6) Interface: a problem in the interaction between components (e.g., parameter list). With that in mind, what’s the defect type of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) in the following commit?
What’s the defect qualifier of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) in the following commit?
A defect qualifier can be one of the following categories: 1) Missing: new code needs to be added to fix the defect; 2) Incorrect: the code is incorrectly implemented and needs adjustment to fix the defect; 3) Extraneous: unnecessary. With that in mind, what’s the defect type of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) in the following commit?
